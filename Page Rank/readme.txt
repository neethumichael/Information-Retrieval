Read me for Homework 2 - Page Rank


1) Page Rank Neethu.zip contains the followig
    a) An executable java file   : PageRank.java
    b) input file for Handin -1  : test-data.txt
    c) input file for Handin 2/3 : wt2g_inlinks.txt
    d) readme.txt
    e) PageRank_hand_in_Neethu.pdf

2) Instructions for compiling and running:
     Compilation:
      javac PageRank.java
     Run:
      java PageRank "filename"
            where filename is "test-data.txt" for the 1st hand-in 
                  "wt2g_inlinks.txt" for the remaining hand-in

3) Output of the program:

a) Output1 - The PageRank values for each vertex(A,B,C,D,E,F) 
             after 1, 10, and 100 iterations of the PageRank algorithm)

b) Output2 - The perplexity values in each round until convergence for in-links file for the WT2g collection.

c) Output3 - The document IDs of the top 50 pages as sorted by PageRank, together with their PageRank values. 
             Also, the document IDs of the top 50 pages by in-link count, together with their in-link counts.
